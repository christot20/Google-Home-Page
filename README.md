# Google-Home-Page
Created a clone of the Google home page by deconstructing and rebuilding the page. 

Used to get a better understanding of HTML and CSS as well as how elements are placed and styled.

1. HTML Semantic Tags and Proper Structure
2. CSS Flexbox and other principles
3. Responsive Design

Project led by The Odin Project.
